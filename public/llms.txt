// Helper to patch Radix/Helmet for the test environment specifically if needed,
// though test-utils handles this for isolated component tests. 
// App.tsx uses providers directly, so we might need to mock them or ensure App uses the patched versions?
// Actually App.tsx imports standard libraries.
// The Node loader (ts-loader) doesn't rewrite imports.
// So App.tsx imports 'react-helmet-async' which returns the Module object { default: ..., HelmetProvider: ... }
// But React code expects `import { HelmetProvider } ...` to work directly.
// In CJS/ESM interop in Node, named imports from CJS modules might fail if not statically analyzable.
// However, I patched `test-utils` to handle it.
// To test `App`, we need to mock the modules that `App` imports to behave correctly, 
// OR we rely on `ts-loader` or `test-setup` to fix it.
// The `test-setup.js` patches globals. 
// Writing a test that renders `App` directly might fail if `App.tsx` has `import { HelmetProvider } ...` and Node sees it as undefined.
// Let's try rendering it.

      title: "The Church",

      title: "The End Times",
      content: "We believe in the imminent rapture of the saved, followed by a seven-year tribulation, the Judgment Seat of Christ and Marriage Supper of the Lamb, Christ's return to defeat the Antichrist at Armageddon, a 1,000-year millennial kingdom, and final judgment of unbelievers before the Great White Throne, after which God will make all things new."

                  The Bible makes it clear: salvation is a <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">gift from God</span>. 
                  You cannot earn it through good works or religious activity. You must simply place your faith 
                  in Jesus Christ and what He did for you on the cross.

                  Ask Him to save you and forgive your sins. The Bible promises that whoever calls on the name 
                  of the Lord will be saved.

                    Together, they dedicated their lives to serving God and ministering to others.

                    For nine years, the Popes served at Gospel Light Baptist Church in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. 
                    During this time, they gained valuable experience ministering to people from varied backgrounds 
                    and leading various ministries and events. These years prepared them for the work God had planned 
                    for them in Texas.

                    After Pastor Pope's father passed away in late 2013, the family sensed God calling them to 
                    church planting in the Austin metro area. Through a series of "divine appointments," the 
                    Austin/Round Rock area repeatedly came to their attention. Through answered prayers, they 
                    became convinced that God wanted them in central Texas.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    The Popes spent a year preparing for this transition, with support from family, their home 
                    church, and other like-minded ministries. They moved to Round Rock in July 2015 to begin 
                    this new chapter, committing to stay and serve long-term.
